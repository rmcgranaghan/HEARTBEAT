Comparing two 2D conv2d_transpose models that are trained on the original pipeline (pipeline1) with the original (Dense neural net) model trained on both pipeline1 and the new pipeline2.  Also compared with the dense model trained one pipeline2 with 15 second training data.  All other training data was at 1 min cadence.  2D polar plots are made as well as time series plots to compare with the DMSP data.  The March 17th comparison uses data that was actually included in training to compare, but the 2010 sc16 data was saved as validation data in all trained models.
